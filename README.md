# Inventor_Stats

**Engineers the likes of which no one had ever dreamed of, Inventors are those that prospect to do great things like the Lords of the Houses of Engineering have accomplished.

Inventors use science to create technologies to rival that of magic. Inventors are also the masters of taking something seemingly worthless and making it into something that can turn the tide of any battle they face. With the right tools and an intimate understanding of science that few truly share, Inventors have the potential to spring forth their own revolutions.**

*You must have an Intelligence score of 13 or higher in order to multiclass in or out of this class.*

### Innovation
You invent either a weapon or armor that has never been invented before. If your innovation is a weapon, choose the basic stats of a simple or martial weapon. You are always proficient in your weapon, no matter what kind of stats you use, and you will use Intelligence as your attack modifier. If your innovation is armor, choose the basic stats of a light or medium armor. You are always proficient in your armor, no matter what kind of stats you use, and you will use Intelligence as your AC modifier instead of Dexterity. Your armor innovation will always have disadvantage on Stealth checks unless relevant modifications have been made. Your innovations use a unique type of fuel made of Kerosene and a few unique elements to give it that extra kick. The amount of fuel available in your innovation to make full use of your modifications will be expressed as Fuel Pips. You have a number of those equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You can refuel your Fuel Pips out of combat if you have a container of Fuel; on a short rest if you just have the ingredients and Alchemist Supplies; or a long rest if you have only Alchemist's Supplies. Anyone who attempts to use your Innovation will not be proficient with it, regardless of which stats you chose, as your Innovation is only understood by you. You can add runes to your innovation like you would any other item. 

### Modifications
You have the ability to hone your Innovation towards more specialized features. Choose two Modifications. Choose another at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

* Rockets (Melee Weapon Innovation): Allows you to keep momentum going when you go to swing. On a hit, you can use the rockets to dig deeper into flesh and add your Intelligence modifier to the total damge. On a miss, you can use the rockets to give a burst of speed fast enough to attempt to hit an adjacent creature. After declaring the use of the rockets, roll a d20. On a roll of 5 or below, the rockets glitch out and need to be repaired using a Bonus Action to make a Tinker's Tools check (DC 10 + (5/dice roll, round down)). Otherwise, you will need to mend the rockets on a short rest or long rest. Rockets use one Fuel Pip.

* Scope (Ranged Weapon Innovation): Allows you to aim more accurately. Use your Bonus Action to look through the scope and turn your disadvantage range into normal range.

* Chemostrike (Weapon Innovation): You have discovered a way to use various chemicals to deliver unconventional damage. Choose Fire, Cold, Lightning, Acid, or Poison. You can use one Fuel Pip to release a capsule of hidden chemicals to cover your blade or ammo and change the damage type to the respective modification. You must declare usage before making an attack roll.

* Shield (Armor Innovation): As a reaction, you can use one Fuel Pip to temporarily bring up a force field to give +7 AC, possibly turning a hit into a miss, and to make you immune to Magic Missile. You can choose not to use this if you know that the AC Bonus won't make the creature miss. The shield lasts until your next turn.

* Rockets (Armor Innovation): As a Bonus Action, you may use one Fuel Pip to gain a fly speed equal to your walking speed for that turn. You can also use two Fuel Pips to give yourself advantage on a Dexterity Saving Throw. After declaring the use of the rockets, roll a d20. On a roll of 5 or below, the rockets glitch out and need to be repaired using a Bonus Action to make a Tinker's Tools check (DC 10 + (5/dice roll, round down)). Otherwise, you will need to mend the rockets on a short rest or long rest.

* Stealth Mode (Armor Innovation): With some input, you can temporarily modify your armor to sacrifice protection for subterfuge. You can manually change your armor to Stealth Mode in five minutes or use one Fuel Pip to change into Stealth Mode as a Bonus Action. If you change to Stealth Mode using a Fuel Pip, roll a d100. If you roll below 20 - class level, the armor goes into an intermediate state with a -3 AC Modifier and still roll Stealth with disadvantage. You will need to spend 5 minutes to put the armor back in its original state. Otherwise, it makes a noise that can be heard from 300 feet away and Stealth Mode is up. Once Stealth Mode is up, you gain a -5 AC modifier and you roll stealth checks normally.

### Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
At 2nd level, your eye for resources starts to become extraordinary. Without tools, you can repair damaged items on top of making these items with the proper raw materials:

* A set of caltrops
* A candle
* A compass
* A crowbar
* A flint and steel
* A hammer
* A ladder
* A piton
* 20ft of rope
* A 10-ft pole
* Lockpicks
* One tool of choice
* Torch

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Tool Master
At 6th level, double your proficiency for any skill check you make with Tools you're proficient in. In addition, add half your proficiency bonus to any skill check with tools you weren't proficient in.

### Overdrive
At 10th Level, you gain the ability to seriously destabilize your Innovation for some very serious upgrades. As an action, you can use one Fuel Pip and declare that you put your Innovation into Overdrive. When your Innovation is in Overdrive, you gain the following benefits:

* (Weapon Innovation) Double your Intelligence modifier for attack and damage rolls.
* (Armor Innovation) Double your movement speed. In addition, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move. You have advantage on Dexterity, Strength, and Constitution Saving Throws.

After 1 minute, your Innovation will give out and you will not be able to use your modifications until you either make a DC 25 Tinker Tools Check or until you long rest. Fixing your innovation in a long rest does not count as strenuous activity. If your innovation is armor, your movement speed is halved and you have disadvantage on all Dexterity checks until repaired. If you fix your Innovation by making a Tinker's Tools Check, you may not use Overdrive until you take a long rest.

### Circle of Engineers
At 14th level, you have become well known among people as a spectacular Engineer in your own right. Whenever you meet with a craftsman, you have advantage on all Charisma checks. Anyone who attempts to act as you will do so with disadvantage.

### Self-Repair
At 18th level, you have modified your Innovations so that they will fix themselves if needed. Whether that's letting physics do the work, giving yourself only a few levers that you can flick without thinking, or however you think it; when your modifications malfunction, you can make an Intelligence check (DC 10 + number of modifications that malfunctioned) to switch on Self-Repair and immediately regain function of all modifications unless they have malfunctioned from Overdrive.

### Masterpiece
At 20th level, the cost of Fuel Pips is now halved (round up). In addition, you may take 3 rounds to haphazardly fix your innovation from Overdrive malfunction. You will be able to use your modifications, but you won't be able to use Overdrive until you take a short rest.
